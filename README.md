# Purbeurre

Purbeurre is a class project: it's a website that aims to find and replace unhealthy food in real life by better substitute.

This project is based on:
- [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/fr/3.0/)
- [Creative Bootstrap theme](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-creative)

## Requirements 

Requirements are given in a pdf. The site should look like that:
![esquisses 1 et 2](/img/esquisses-1-2.jpg)
![esquisses 3 et 4](/img/esquisses-3-4.jpg)

```bash
pip install foobar

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
